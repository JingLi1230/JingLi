    <p>Welcome! I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Georgia, pursuing a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology and an M.S. in Statistics. My research focuses on psychometric modeling, educational measurement, and the application of Rasch measurement theory and explanatory item response models. I have experience applying advanced statistical techniques and psychometric methods to real-world data in the fields of education, psychology, and public health. My expertise includes Rasch modeling (RM), explanatory item response modeling (EIRM), structural equation modeling (SEM), diagnostic classification modeling (DCM), all aimed at supporting data-informed decision-making.
